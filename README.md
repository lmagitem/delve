# Delve
The idea is to adapt the wonderful game [Delve](https://blackwellwriter.itch.io/delve-a-solo-map-drawing-game) made by Anna Blackwell, and to do it so in a way that doesn't expose the games rules to people that didn't bought the game.

## Architecture
This project is to be written in React with a heavy use of Storybook to test and document, and using PocketBase as backend. It will be hosted on my Vultr-provided server and served by a simple Node.js app, using Nginx as a reverse proxy.
